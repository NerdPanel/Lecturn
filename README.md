# Lecturn
The Lecturn holds all of the Minecraft Server knowledge... and urls too

Lecturn *turns* an inputted Minecraft version into a fully-functioning Minecraft server! As of now it only supports Minecraft (vanilla). Eventually it will support Fabric, Forge, Neoforge, Quilt, Paper, many forks of Paper, and many more!
